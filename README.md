# Analysis of Findings
This analysis examined how drivers respond to digital coupons, with a particular focus on bar and carry out coupons. The results show that coupon acceptance depends strongly on the type of coupon being offered to the driver.

Bar coupons were accepted primarily by drivers whose behavior and life context already aligned with visiting bars. Drivers who frequently go to bars, did not have children as passengers, were younger, or were in more flexible life stages were substantially more likely to accept bar coupons than drivers who did not fall into one of these categories. This suggests that bar coupons are most effective when targeted toward specific segments of the population rather than broadly distributed. For example, it would make sense to focus distribution in areas with high concentrations of young, working professionals rather than in more suburban, family oriented areas.

In contrast, carry out coupons were broadly appealing across nearly all groups examined. Acceptance rates were consistently around 73 percent across most demographics, with little variation by age, family status, occupation, or prior carry out frequency. This implies that, unlike bar coupons, carry out coupons are well suited for wide distribution and do not require narrow targeting. They can be offered in many contexts where bar coupons might prove ineffective. Two notable exceptions were observed: high income earners accepted carry out coupons at a slightly lower rate, while food service workers accepted them at a much higher rate. The former likely reflects lower price sensitivity, while the latter suggests greater familiarity and comfort with ordering food for takeout.

Overall, these findings suggest that carry out coupons are well suited for broad distribution, while bar coupons benefit from demographic and behavioral targeting. The effectiveness of digital coupons depends not only on the discount itself, but on how well the offer aligns with the lifestyles and constraints of the intended audience.
